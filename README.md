Hacker News Project 

We are exploring Hacker News posts, specifically, the comparison of two different types of posts, Ask HN and Show HN posts.
We will campare these two types of posts to learn the following:
Do Ask HN or Show HN recieve more comments on average?
Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?
We are working with a reduced dataset, shrunk from 300,000 to 20,000 rows. This was done by removing posts with no comments and randomly sampling the rest to hit the smaller size.

Visualizing Earnings Based On College Majors

In this project, I'll explore how using the pandas plotting functionality along with the Jupyter notebook interface allows exploring data quickly using visualizations.

I'll be working with a dataset on the job outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012. The original data on job outcomes was released by American Community Survey, which conducts surveys and aggregates the data. FiveThirtyEight cleaned the dataset and released it on their Github repo.

Using visualizations, I will start to explore questions from the dataset like: Do students in more popular majors make more money?

Using scatter plots: 
How many majors are predominantly male? 
Predominantly female?

Using histograms Which category of majors have the most students? Using bar plots. I'll explore how to do these and more while primarily working in pandas.

Visualizing The Gender Gap In College Degrees

In this project, I'll extend on previous work:visualizing the gender gap across college degrees.

There was a focus on STEM degrees but now I will generate line charts to compare across all degree categories. In the last step of this project, I'll explore how to export the final diagram I create as an image file.

Exploring Ebay Car Sales Data: Kleinanseigen Dataset

We'll work with a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classifieds section of the German eBay website.
The dataset was originally scraped and uploaded to Kaggle. A few modifications were made from the original dataset that was uploaded to Kaggle.
The aim of this project is to clean the data, analyze the included used car listings, and become familiar with some of the unique benefits jupyter notebook provides for pandas.
