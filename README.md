Hacker News Project 

We are exploring Hacker News posts, specifically, the comparison of two different types of posts, Ask HN and Show HN posts.
We will campare these two types of posts to learn the following:
Do Ask HN or Show HN recieve more comments on average?
Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?
We are working with a reduced dataset, shrunk from 300,000 to 20,000 rows. This was done by removing posts with no comments and randomly sampling the rest to hit the smaller size.

Exploring Ebay Car Sales Data: Kleinanseigen Dataset

We'll work with a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classifieds section of the German eBay website.
The dataset was originally scraped and uploaded to Kaggle. A few modifications were made from the original dataset that was uploaded to Kaggle.
The aim of this project is to clean the data, analyze the included used car listings, and become familiar with some of the unique benefits jupyter notebook provides for pandas.
