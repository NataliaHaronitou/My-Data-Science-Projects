Hacker News Project 

We are eploring Hacker News posts, specifically, the comparison of two different types of posts, Ask HN and Show HN posts.

We will campare these two types of posts to learn the following:
Do Ask HN or Show HN recieve more comments on average?
Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?
We are working with a reduced dataset, shrunk from 300,000 to 20,000 rows. This was done by removing posts with no comments and randomly sampling the rest to hit the smaller size.
